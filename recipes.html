      <p>The recipe for Chicken Pakodis is quite uniform, whosoever makes it. Here I am sharing with you a <br>
        recipe and method which is unique to the Andhra kitchens. I am also avoiding the use of any food <br>
        colour,Ajinomoto, Maida, or Corn Flour. The Chicken Pakodi is good for starters of course; but it is<br>
         equally good as a side fried dish along with the main course.

         <h2>
          Tips
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Some details to note about the Chicken:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          • Buy the chicken weighing an exact one Kg, so that the meat is tender. If you buy a bigger chicken, you <br>
          will find that the marinate does not stick to very well. Also, a heavy bird will remain tough like rubber<br> 
          inside, however much you fry it.<br>

          • Cut the chicken into medium size pieces. If the pieces are too small, they tend to get over-fried and <br>
          shrink further.<br>
          • You can also use boneless chicken meat to make the Chicken Pakodi.<br>

          • The chicken should be left at least for one hour for the spices to seep well into the meat.<br>
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>The coating will not fall off if you do this:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          • The coating should be thick. Otherwise it will fall off when being fried. Mix water gradually using a<br> 
          spoon so that the coating does not get too thin.<br>
          • If you like, add 2 spoons of beaten egg to the coating batter so that the batter will stay on the chicken<br>
          pieces firmly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Method of Frying the Chicken:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          • Put the chicken pieces in very hot oil. Then fry the pieces on a medium flame until the colour changes.<br>
           The chicken will get cooked well inside only when the pieces turn light brown. Otherwise it will be fried<br>
            outside and remain raw inside.<br>

          • After the pieces turn golden brown, fry on high frame till pieces turn crispy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Some more points to note:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          • I have not used food colour and Ajinomoto which most street food recipes mandatorily use. Food <br>
          colour is not a big deal, but I feel that adding Ajinomoto definitely brings out a different taste. You may<br>
          use it if you like its taste.<br>
          • If you are opting for the flavour and taste of the street food type, add Maida and Cornflour. I have<br>
          added Rice flour for crispiness and gram flour (Besan) for softness of texture.<br>
          • The dish becomes interesting if we fry slit green chillies, Curry leaves, a few groundnuts or cashew<br>
          nuts and sprinkle over the fried chicken.<br>
          • If you like, you may serve the Chicken Pakodi with Tomato Sauce.
